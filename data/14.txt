We should be able to publish regardless of the software we use, the computer we have, the language we speak, whether we are wired or wireless, regardless of our sensory or interaction modes. We should be able to access the web from any kind of hardware that can connect to the Internet – stationary or mobile, small or large. W3C facilitates this listening and blending via international web standards. These standards ensure that all the crazy brilliance continues to improve a web that is open to us all. Browsers, Media Players There are many types of tools that allow us to read the Web, including browsers, media players, publishing platforms, social networks, bots, aggregators, forums, and media-sharing sites. Authoring Tools, Social Media The Web is not a read-only medium. There are many types of tools for publishing content, including authoring tools and environments, content management systems (CMSs), social media profile pages and apps, blogging tools and sites, microblogging tools, social bookmarks, forums, and video and photo sharing and more.
