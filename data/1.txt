We wish to make it easier for underrepresented communities to contribute to our important work: making the Web work, for everyone. The Web standards that we create need to reflect the diversity of the whole world. More background, more use cases, more edge cases, do eventually bring higher quality results, and lead to a more inclusive design and a better Web. For a few years now, we have developed methods to improve diversity at the World Wide Web Consortium. One such means is to be in a position to welcome more contributors at our annual conference: TPAC (“Technical Plenary / Advisory Committee”). Because during that event, the W3C work groups gather, network, and work to resolve challenging technical or social issues, it is one of the most important rendez-vous for the Web community. We recently released a short video introducing TPAC. This year’s fund is sponsored by W3C, Adobe, Samsung Electronics, Coil, Charles Nevile, Microsoft, TetraLogical, Siteimprove, and an anonymous donor. We recognize and thank donors for this important gesture. You may be interested in reading on the topic of diversity and inclusion at W3C. Our CEO Jeff Jaffe published a 2021 update last month. New video introduces TPAC — our annual conference 8 July 2021 | Archive W3C released today a short video introducing our annual conference. TPAC is the acclaimed event where web standards are developed for the benefit of humanity. Watch the video to learn how the Web community engages at this important rendez-vous, how together we create momentum, brainstorm and coordinate work, how together the Web Consortium makes the Web work, for everyone.

Web Audio API is a W3C Recommendation 17 June 2021 | Archive The Audio Working Group has published Web Audio API as a W3C Recommendation.
