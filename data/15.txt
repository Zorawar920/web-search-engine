To accomplish this work, W3C follows processes that promote the development of high-quality standards based on the consensus of the community. W3C processes promote fairness, responsiveness, and progress, all facets of the W3C mission. Intro to Standards The W3C technical report development process is the set of steps and requirements followed by W3C Working Groups to standardize Web technology. Through this process, W3C seeks to maximize consensus about the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, to promote consistency among specifications, and to earn endorsement by W3C and the broader community. Learn more in the introduction to the W3C Process. Input to the W3C standards process may come from a variety of places, including: W3C Workshops Incubator Groups Member Submissions Team Submissions Value of Creating Standards at W3C W3C continues to evolve to provide the community a productive environment for creating Web standards. W3C standards: are created following a consensus-based decision process; consider aspects of accessibility, privacy, security, and internationalization; reflect the views of diverse industries and global stakeholders; balance speed, fairness, public accountability, and quality; benefit from Royalty-Free patent licensing commitments from participants; are stable (and W3C seeks to ensure their persistence at the published URI); benefit from wide review from groups inside and outside W3C; are downloadable at no cost; are maintained in a predictable fashion; are strengthened through interoperability testing; Business Case for Standards Here is a selection of community viewpoints on the value of Web Standards.
